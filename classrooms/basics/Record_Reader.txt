Create a text file
Example: C:\Users\Public\Documents\beme_records.txt
Let the file have some student information
Example:
```
sl_no,first_name,last_name,age
1,John,Doe,20
2,Jane,Doe,19
```
Create a python file
record_reader.py
Read the file content as list and print it.

open(file_name, mode)
This returns to you a file object
file_name: Name of the file to be opened
mode: Mode in which the file is opened
r: Read mode
w: Write mode
a: Append mode

f_reader = open(file_name, mode)
f_reader has a function readlines which returns a list of lines in the file as a list
So you call the function like this
f_reader.readlines()
Since you want to store the contents read in some variable, you can do this:
records = f_reader.readlines()
